## 🤔 Why Use These Technologies?

- **⚪ React**: Component-based architecture for scalable UI.
- **🔵 TypeScript**: Static typing helps catch errors early.
- **⚡ Vite**: Faster builds and hot module replacement.
- **🔄 React Query**: Simplifies data fetching & caching.
- **🛣 React Router**: Declarative routing for navigation.

## 🚀 How to Scale Using the Existing Tech Stack

1. ♻ **Component Reusability**: Break down UI into reusable components.
2. 🛋 **State Management**: Use React Query for server state; consider Redux/Zustand for client state.
3. 🚫 **Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports & `React.Suspense` to improve load time.
4. ⚡ **Performance Optimization**: Use memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
5. 🧪 **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests to maintain stability as the app grows.
